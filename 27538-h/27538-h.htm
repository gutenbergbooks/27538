<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL RECORDS.</h3>

<p>The two principal causes of the loss of these records are, the
abstraction of them by Edward I. in 1292, and the destruction of a
great many others by the reformers in their religious zeal. It so
happens that up to the time of King Robert Bruce, the history is not
much to be depended on. A great many valuable papers connected with
the ancient ecclesiastical state of Scotland were carried off to the
Continent by the members of the ancient hierarchy, who retired there
after the Reformation. Many have, no doubt, been destroyed by time,
and in the destruction of their depositories by revolutions and
otherwise. That a great many are yet in existence abroad, as well as
at home, which would throw great light on Scottish history, and which
have not yet been discovered, there is no doubt, notwithstanding the
unceremonious manner in which many of them were treated. At the
time when the <i>literati</i> were engaged in investigating the
authenticity of Ossian's <i>Poems</i> (to go no farther back), it was
stated that there was in the library of the Scotch College at Douay a
Gaelic MS. of several of the poems of great antiquity, and which, if
produced, would have set the question at rest. On farther inquiry,
however, it was stated that it had been torn up, along with others,
and used by the students for the purpose of kindling the fires. It
is gratifying to the antiquary that discoveries are from time to time
being made, of great importance: it was announced lately that there
had been discovered at the Treasury a series of papers relating to the
rebellion of 1715-16, consisting chiefly of informations of persons
said to have taken part in the rising; and an important mass of papers
relative to the rebellion of 1745-46. There has also been discovered
at the Chapter House at Westminster, the correspondence between Edward
I., Edward II., and their lieutenants in Scotland, Aymer de Valance,
Earl of Pembroke, John, Earl of Warren, and Hugh Cressingham. The
letters patent have also been found, by which, in 1304, William
Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrew's, testified his having come into
the peace of the king of England, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="page406" id="page406">{406}</a></span> bound himself to answer for the
temporalities of his bishopric to the English king. Stray discoveries
are now and then made in the charter-rooms of royal burghs, as
sometime ago there was found in the Town-house of Aberdeen a charter
and several confirmations by King Robert Bruce. The ecclesiastical
records of Scotland also suffered in our own day; the original
charters of the assembly from 1560 to 1616 were presented to the
library of Sion College, London Wall, London, in 1737, by the
Honorable Archibald Campbell (who had been chosen by the Presbyters
as Bishop of Aberdeen in 1721), under such conditions as might
effectually prevent them again becoming the property of the Kirk of
Scotland. Their production having been requested by a committee of the
House of Commons, the records were produced and laid on the table of
the committee-room on the 5th of May, 1834. They were consumed in the
fire which destroyed the houses of parliament on the 16th of October
of the same year. It was only after 1746, and on the breaking up
of the feudal system, when men's minds began to calm down, that any
attention was paid to Scottish antiquities. Indeed, previous to that
period, had any one asked permission to examine the charter chests
of our most ancient families, purely for a literary purpose, he would
have been suspected of maturing evidence for the purpose of depriving
them of their estates. No such objection now exists, and every
facility is afforded both the publishing clubs and private individuals
in their researches. Much has been done by the Abbotsford, Bannatyne,
Maitland, Roxburgh, Spalding, and other clubs, in elucidating Scottish
history and antiquities, but much remains to be done. "If it were
done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly," as every
day lost renders the attainment of the object more difficult; and it
is to be hoped that these clubs will be supported as they deserve.

<h3>PATRICK CAREY.</h3>

<p>Looking over Evelyn's <i>Diary</i>, edited by Mr. Barry, 4to., 2nd
edit., London, 1819, I came upon the following. Evelyn being at Rome,
in 1644, says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I was especially recommended to Father John, a Benedictine Monk and
Superior of the Order for the English College of Douay; a person of
singular learning, religion, and humanity; also to Mr. Patrick Cary, an
abbot, brother to our learned Lord Falkland, a witty young priest, who
afterwards came over to our church."</p></blockquote>

<p>It immediately occurred to me, that this "witty young priest" might
be Sir Walter Scott's <i>protégé</i>, and the author of "<i>Triviall
Poems and Triolets</i>, written in obedience to Mrs. Tomkins' commands
by Patrick Carey, Aug. 20, 1651," and published for the first time at
London in 1820, from a MS. in the possession of the editor.</p>

<p>Sir Walter, in introducing his "forgotten poet," merely informs us
that his author "appears to have been a gentleman, a loyalist, a
lawyer, and a rigid high churchman, if not a Roman Catholic."</p>

<p>In the first part of this book, which the author calls his "Triviall
Poems," the reader will find ample proof that his character would fit
the "witty young priest" of Evelyn; as well as the gentle blood,
and hatred to the Roundheads of Sir Walter. As a farther proof that
Patrick Carey the priest, and Patrick the poet, may be identical, take
the following from one of his poems, comparing the old Church with the
existing one:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">"Our Church still flourishing w' had seene,</p>
<p class="i4">If th' holy-writt had euer beene</p>
<p class="i4">Kept out of laymen's reach;</p>
<p class="i4">But, when 'twas English'd, men halfe-witted,</p>
<p class="i4">Nay, woemen too, would be permitted,</p>
<p class="i4">T' expound all texts and preach."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The second part of Carey's poetical essays is entitled "I will sing
unto the Lord," and contains a few "Triolets;" all of an ascetic
savour, and strongly confirmatory of the belief that the author may
have taken the monastic vow:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">"Worldly designes, feares, hopes, farwell!</p>
<p class="i4">Farwell all earthly joyes and cares!</p>
<p class="i4">On nobler thoughts my soule shall dwell;</p>
<p class="i4">Worldly designes, feares, hopes, farwell!</p>
<p class="i4">Att quiett, in my peaceful cell,</p>
<p class="i4">I'le thincke on God, free from your snares;</p>
<p class="i4">Worldly designes, feares, hopes, farwell!</p>
<p class="i4">Farwell all earthly joys and cares.</p>
</div></div>

<hr />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Pleasure att courts is but in show,</p>
<p class="i4">With true content in cells wee meete;</p>
<p class="i4">Yes (my deare Lord!) I've found it soe,</p>
<p class="i4">Noe joyes but thine are purely sweete!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The quotation from the Psalms, which forms the title to this second
part, is placed above "a helmet and a shield," which Sir Walter
has transferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="page407" id="page407">{407}</a></span> to his title. This "bears what heralds call a cross
anchorée, or a cross moline, with a motto, <i>Tant que je
puis</i>." With the exception of the rose beneath this, there is no
identification here of Patrick Carey with the Falkland family. This
cross, placed before religious poems, may however be intended to
indicate their subjects, and the writer's profession, rather than his
family escutcheon; although that may be pointed at in the rose alluded
to, the Falklands bearing "on a bend three roses of the field."</p>

<p class='author'>J. O.</p>

<p class='note'>["Ah! you do not know Pat Carey, a younger brother of Lord
    Falkland's," says the disguised Prince Charles to Dr. Albany
    Rochecliffe in Sir Walter Scott's <i>Woodstock</i>. So
    completely has the fame of the great Lord Falkland eclipsed
    that of his brothers, that many are, doubtless, in the same
    blissful state with good Dr. Rochecliffe, although <i>two</i>
    editions of the poet's works have been given to the world.
    In 1771, Mr. John Murray published the poems of Carey, from
    a collection alleged to be in the hands of a Rev. Pierrepont
    Cromp, apparently a fictitious name. In 1820, Sir Walter
    Scott, ignorant, as he confesses himself, at the time of an

    original MS. presented to him by Mr. Murray. In a note in
    <i>Woodstock</i>, Sir Walter sums up the information he had
    procured concerning the author, which, scanty as it is, is
    not without interest. "Of Carey," he says, "the second editor,
    like the first, only knew the name and the spirit of the
    verses. He has since been enabled to ascertain that the poetic
    cavalier was a younger brother of the celebrated Henry Lord
    Carey, who fell at the battle of Newberry, and escaped the
    researches of Horace Walpole, to whose list of noble authors
    he would have been an important addition." The first edition
    of the poems appeared under the following title, <i>Poems from
    a Manuscript written in the Time of Oliver Cromwell</i>, 4to.
    1771, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>: Murray. It contains only
    nine pieces, whereas the present edition contains

<h3>INEDITED LYRIC BY FELICIA HEMANS.</h3>

<p>A short time since I discovered the following in the handwriting
of Mrs. Hemans, and it accompanied an invitation of a more prosaic
description to a gentleman of her acquaintance, and a relative of
mine, now deceased. I thought it worth preserving, in case any future
edition of her works appeared; but the 13th, 14th, and 15th lines are
defective, from the seal, or some other accident, having torn them
off, and one is missing. And though perhaps it would not be difficult
to restore them, yet I have not ventured to do so myself. The last two
lines appear to convey a melancholy foreboding of the poet's sad and
early fate. Can any one restore the defective parts?</p>

<h3>"GREEN EYES."</h3>

<p>Having long been familiar with only one instance of the possession
of eyes of this hue&mdash;the well-known case of the "<i>green-eyed</i>
monster Jealousy,"&mdash;and not having been led by that association to
think of them as a beauty, I have been surprised lately at finding
them not unfrequently seriously admired. <i>Ex. gr.</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"<i>Victorian.</i> How is that and <i>green-eyed</i> Gaditana</p>

<p class="i4">Longfellow's <i>Spanish Student</i>, Act II. Sc. 3.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Longfellow adds in a note:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Spaniards, with good reason, consider this colour of the
    eye as beautiful, and celebrate it in a song; as, for example,
    in the well-known Villancico:</p></blockquote>

</div></div>

<p>And lastly, see <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, Act IV. Sc. 4., where
the ordinary text has:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here "The MS. corrector of the folio 1682 converts 'grey' into
'<i>green</i>:' 'Her eyes are <i>green</i> as<span class='pagenum'><a name="page408" id="page408">{408}</a></span> <i>grass</i>;' and such,
we have good reason to suppose, was the true reading." (Collier's
<i>Shakspeare Notes and Emendations</i>, p. 25.)</p>

<p>The modern slang, "Do you see anything <i>green</i> in my eye?" can
hardly, I suppose, be called in evidence on the question of beauty
or ugliness. Is there any more to be found in favour of "<i>green
eyes</i>?"</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p><i>On the Death of Falstaff</i> (Vol. viii., p. 314.).&mdash;The remarks
of your correspondents J. B. and <span class="smcap">Nemo</span> on this subject are so
obvious, and I think I may also admit in a measure so just, that
it appears to me only respectful to them, and to all who may feel
reluctant to give up Theobald's reading, that I should give some
detailed reason for dissenting from their conclusion.</p>

<p>In the first place, when Falstaff began to "play with flowers and
smile upon his fingers' ends," it was no far-fetched thought to place
him in fancy among green fields; and if the disputed passage were in
immediate connexion with the above, the argument in its favour would
be stronger. But, unfortunately, Mrs. Quickly brings in here the
conclusion at which she arrives: "I knew there was but one way;
<i>for</i>," she adds, as a farther reason, and referring to the
physical evidences upon his frame of the approach of death, "his
nose was as sharp as a pen on a table of green frieze." We can hardly
imagine him "babbling" at this moment. "How now, Sir John, quoth I;"
she continues, apparently to rouse him: "What, man! be of good cheer.
<i>So</i> [thus roused] 'a cried out&mdash;God, God, God! three or four
times: now, I to <i>comfort</i> him," &amp;c. Does this look as though he
were in the happy state of mind your correspondents imagine? I take
no account of his crying out of sack and of women, &amp;c., as that might
have been at an earlier period. At the same time it does not follow,
had Shakspeare intended to replace him in fancy amid the scenes of his
youth, that he should have talked of them. A man who is (or imagines
he is) in green fields, does not talk about green fields, however
he may enjoy them. Both your correspondents seem to anticipate this
difficulty, and meet it by supposing Falstaff to be "babbling
snatches of hymns;" but this I conceive to be far beyond the limits
of reasonable conjecture. In fact, the whole of their very beautiful
theory rests upon the very disputed passage in question. At an earlier
period apparently, his mind did wander; when, as Mrs. Quickly says,
he was "rheumatick," meaning doubtless <i>lunatic</i>, that is,
delirious; and then he talked of other things. When he began to
"fumble with the sheets, and play with flowers, and smile upon his
fingers' ends," though for a moment he might have fancied himself
even "in his mother's lap," or anything else, he was clearly past
all "babbling." In saying this, I treat Falstaff as a human being who
lived and died, and whose actions were recorded by the faithfullest
observer of Nature that ever wrote.</p>

<p class="i2">"Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,</p>

<p class="i2">To make cold nymphs chaste crowns."</p>

<p class="i8"><i>Tempest</i>, Act IV. Sc. 1.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The above is the reading of the first folio. <i>Pioned</i> is
explained by <span class="smcap">Mr. Collier</span>, "to dig," as in Spenser; but
<span class="smcap">Mr. Halliwell</span> (<i>Monograph Shakspeare</i>, vol. i. p.
425.) finds no authority to support such an interpretation. <span class="smcap">Mr.
Collier's</span> anonymous annotator writes "tilled;" but surely this
is a very artificial process to be performed by "spongy April." Hanmer
proposed "peonied;" Heath, "lilied;" and <span class="smcap">Mr. Halliwell</span> admits
this is more poetical (and surely more correct), but appears to prefer
"twilled," embroidered or interwoven with flowers. A friend of mine
suggested that "lilied" was peculiarly appropriate to form "cold
nymphs chaste crowns," from its imputed power as a preserver of
chastity: and in <span class="smcap">Mr. Halliwell's</span> folio, several examples
are quoted from old poets of "peony" spelt "piony;" and of both
<i>peony</i> and <i>lily</i> as "defending from unchaste thoughts."
Surely, then, the reading of the first folio is a mere typographical
error, and <i>peonied</i> and <i>lilied</i> the most poetical and
correct.</p>

<p><i>Monumental Inscriptions</i> (Vol. viii., p. 215. &amp;c.).&mdash;I
have never seen the monumental inscription of Theodore Pal&aelig;ologus
accurately copied in any book. When in Cornwall lately, I took the
trouble to copy it, and as some of your readers may like to see the
thing as it is, I send it line for line, word for word, and letter for
letter. It is found, as is well known, in the little out-of-the-way
church of St. Landulph, near Saltash.</p>

<blockquote><p>Here lyeth the body of Theodoro Paleologus<br />

the victory near Hochstett, anno 1704. (By the Reverend Thomas Earle,
afterwards Vicar of Malmesbury?)</p>

<blockquote><p>"And so I pass to the great and glorious occasion of this

    Almighty God for ... mercies and deliverances. For y<sup>e</sup> happy
    success of her Majesty's arms both by land and sea [under the]
    Duke of Marlborough, whose fame now flies through the world,
    and whose glorious actions will render his name illustrious,
    and rank him among the renowned worthies of all ages. Had that
    threatning Bullet, w<sup>h</sup> bespattered him all over with dirt,
    only that he might shine the brighter afterwards; had it, I
    say, took away his Life, he had gone down to the grave with
    the laurels in his hand."</p></blockquote>

<p>Is this incident of the bullet mentioned in any of the cotemporary
accounts of the battle?</p>

<p class='author'>E.</p>


<p><i>Etymology of "till," "until."</i>"&mdash;Many monosyllables in language
are, upon examination, found to be in reality compounds, disguised
by contraction. A few instances are, <i>non</i>, Lat. ne-un-(us);
<i>dont</i>, Fr. de-unde; <i>such</i>, Eng. so-like; <i>which</i>,
who-like. In like manner I believe <i>till</i>, to-while, and
<i>until</i>, unto-while. Now <i>while</i> is properly a substantive,
and signifies <i>time</i>, corresponding to <i>dum</i>, Lat., in many
of its uses, which again is connected with <i>diu</i>, <i>dies</i>,
both which are used in the indefinite sense of <i>a while</i>, as well
as in the definite sense of <i>a day</i>. <i>Adesdum</i>, come here
a while; <i>interdum</i>, between whiles. If &#964;&#949; (Gr.) is
connected with this root, then &#7953;&#963;&#964;&#949;, to-while, till. Lawrence
Minot says, "<i>To time</i> (till) he thinks to fight."</p>

<p><i>Dum</i> has the double meaning of <i>while</i> and <i>to-while</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dog-whipping Day in Hull.</i>&mdash;There was some time since the
singular custom in Hull, of whipping all the dogs that were found
running about the streets on October 10; and some thirty years since,
when I was a boy, so common was the practice, that every little urchin
considered it his duty to prepare a whip for any unlucky dog that
might be seen in the streets on this day. This custom is now obsolete,
those "putters down" of all boys' play in the streets&mdash;the new
police&mdash;having effectually stopped this cruel pastime of the Hull
boys. Perhaps some of your readers may be able to give a more correct
origin of this singular custom than the one I now give from tradition:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Previous to the suppression of monasteries in Hull, it was
    the custom for the monks to provide liberally for the poor and
    the wayfarer who came to the fair, held annually on the 11th
    of October; and while busy in this necessary preparation the
    day before the fair, a dog strolled into the larder, snatched
    up a joint of meat and decamped with it. The cooks gave the
    alarm; and when the dog got into the street, he was pursued by
    the expectants of the charity of the monks, who were waiting
    outside the gate, and made to give up the stolen joint.
    Whenever, after this, a dog showed his face, while this
    annual preparation was going on, he was instantly beaten
    off. Eventually this was taken up by the boys; and, until the
    introduction of the new police, was rigidly put in practice by
    them every 10th of October."</p></blockquote>

<p>I write this on October 10, 1853: and so effectually has this custom
been suppressed, that I have neither seen nor heard of any dog having
been this day whipped according to ancient custom.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>


<h3>POLARISED LIGHT.</h3>

<p>During the last summer, while amusing myself with verifying a
statement of Sir D. Brewster respecting the light of the rainbow, viz.
that it is polarised in particular planes, I observed a phenomenon
which startled me exceedingly, inasmuch as it was quite new to me at
the time; and, notwithstanding subsequent inquiries, I cannot find
that it has been observed by any other person. I found that <i>the
light of the blue sky is partially polarised</i>. When analysed with
a Nicols' prism, the contrast with the surrounding clouds is very
remarkable; so much so, indeed, that clouds of extreme tenuity, which
make no impression whatever on the un-assisted eye, are rendered
plainly visible.</p>

<p>The most complete polarisation seems to take place near the horizon;
and, when the sun is near the meridian, towards the west and east. The
depth of colour appears to be immaterial, as far as I have been
able to ascertain with an instrument but rudely constructed for the
purpose. The light is polarised in planes passing through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="page410" id="page410">{410}</a></span> eye of
the observer, and arcs of great circles intersecting the sun's disc.</p>

<p>From the absence (so far as I am aware) of all mention of this
remarkable fact in works on the subject, I am led to conclude that it
is something new; should this, however, turn out otherwise, I shall be
obliged by a reference to any author who explains the phenomenon.
The greater intensity towards the horizon would point to successive
refractions as the most probable theory.</p>

<p><i>Etymology of "The Lizard."</i>&mdash;What is the etymology of the name
"The Lizard," as applied in our maps to that long low green point,
stretching out into the sea at the extreme south of England? My idea
of the etymology would be (judging from the name and pronunciation
of a small town in the immediate neighbourhood of the point)
<i>lys-ard</i>, from two Celtic words: the first, <i>lys</i>, as found
in the name <i>Lismore</i>, and others of a like class in Ireland and
the Highlands of Scotland; the second <i>ard</i>, a long point running
into the sea. In Cornwall, to my ear, the name had quite the Celtic
intonation <i>L&#x304;ys-&#x304;ard</i>; not at all like <i>L&#774;iz&#x304;ard</i>,
as we would speak it, short.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

<p><i>Siller Gun of Dumfries.</i>&mdash;Can any of your readers tell me the
history of the "Siller Gun of Dundee" [Dumfries], and give me an
account of the annual shooting for it?</p>


<p class='author'>O. L. R. G.</p>


<blockquote><p>[The Siller gun of Dumfries is a small silver tube, like the
    barrel of a pistol, but derives great importance from its
    being the gift of James VI., that monarch having ordained
    it as a prize to the best marksman among the corporations of
    Dumfries. The contest was, by royal authority, licensed to
    take place every year; but in consequence of the trouble and
    expense attending it, the custom has not been so frequently
    observed. Whenever the festival was appointed, the 4th of
    June, during the long reign of George III., was invariably
    chosen for that purpose, being his majesty's birthday. The
    institution itself may be regarded as a memorial of the
    <i>Waponshaw</i>, or showing of arms, the shooting at butts
    and bowmarks, and other military and gymnastic sports,
    introduced by our ancestors to keep alive, by competition and
    prizes, the martial ardour and heroic spirit of the people.
    In archery, the usual prize to the best shooter was a silver
    arrow: at Dumfries the contest was transferred to fire-arms.
    See the preface to the <i>Siller Gun</i>, a poem in five
    cantos, by John Mayne, 1836.]</p></blockquote>

of Macclesfield of the same family as that which, in consequence of a

    addition. Blackstone (book <span class="smcap">ii.</span> cap. 12.) says, "which
    term I shall explain in the very words of Littleton: 'It
    seemeth that this word <i>hotchpot</i> is in English a
    pudding; for in a pudding is not commonly just one thing
    alone, but one thing with other things together.' By this
    housewifely metaphor our ancestors meant to inform us that the

    The latter is the language which the Dutch colonists of the
    Cape carried with them, when that colony was conquered by them

<h3>STONE PILLAR WORSHIP AND IDOL WORSHIP.</h3>


<p class='center'>(Vol. v., p. 121.; Vol. vii., p. 383.)</p>

<p><i>Stone Pillar Worship.</i>&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">J. E. Tennent</span> inquires
whether any traces of this worship are to be found in Ireland, and
refers to a letter from a correspondent of Lord Roden's, which states
that the peasantry of the island of Inniskea, off the coast of Mayo,
hold in reverence a stone idol called <i>Neevougi</i>. This word I
cannot find in my Irish dictionary, but it is evidently a diminutive,
formed from the word <i>Eevan</i> (Iomhaigh), image, or
idol: and it is remarkable that the scriptural Hebrew term for idol
is identical with the Irish, or nearly so&mdash;<span class='lfont'>&#1488;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1504;</span>
(<i>Eevan</i>), derived from a root signifying <i>negation</i>, and
applied to the vanity of idols, and to the idols themselves.</p>

<p>I saw at Kenmare, in the county of Kerry, in the summer of 1847, a
water-worn fragment of clay slate, bearing a rude likeness to the
human form, which the peasantry called <i>Eevan</i>. Its original
location was in or near the old graveyard of Kilmakillogue, and it
was regarded with reverence as the image of some saint in "the ould
auncient times," as an "ould auncient" native of Tuosist (the lonely
place) informed me. In the same immediate neighbourhood is a gullaune
(gallán), or stone pillar, at which the peasantry used
"to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="page414" id="page414">{414}</a></span> rounds;" also the curious small lakes or tarns, on which the
islands were said to move on July 8, St. Quinlan's [Kilian?] Day. (See
Smith's <i>History of Kerry</i>.)</p>

<p>However, such superstitious usages are fast falling into desuetude;
and, whatever may have been the early history of Eevan, it is a
sufficient proof of no vestige of stone pillar worship remaining in
Tuosist, that, to gratify the whim of a young gentleman, some peasants
from the neighbourhood removed this stone fragment by boat to Kenmare
the spring of 1846, where it now lies, perched on the summit of a
limestone rock in the grounds of the nursery-house.</p>

<p><i>Idol Worship.</i>&mdash;The islands of Inniskea, on the north-west coast
of Ireland, are said to be inhabited by a population of about four
hundred human beings, who speak the Irish language, and retain among
them a trace of that government by chiefs which in former times
existed in Ireland. The present chief or king of Inniskea is an
intelligent peasant, whose authority is universally acknowledged,
and the settlement of all disputes is referred to his decision.
Occasionally they have been visited by wandering schoolmasters, but
so short and casual have such visits been, that there are not
ten individuals who even know the letters of any language. Though
nominally Roman Catholics, these islanders have no priest resident
among them, and their worship consists in occasional meetings at
their chief's house, with visits to a holy well. Here the absence of
religion is filled with the open practice of pagan idolatry; for in
the south island a stone idol, called in the Irish <i>Neevougi</i>,
has been from time immemorial religiously preserved and worshipped.
This god, in appearance, resembles a thick roll of homespun flannel,
which arises from a custom of dedicating a material of their dress to
it whenever its aid is sought: this is sewed on by an old woman,
its priestess, whose peculiar care it is. They pray to it in time of
sickness. It is invoked when a storm is desired to dash some helpless
ship upon the coast; and, again, the exercise of its power is
solicited in calming the angry waves to admit of fishing.</p>

<p>Such is a brief outline of these islanders and their god; but of
the early history of this idol no authentic information has yet been
obtained. Can any of your numerous readers furnish an account of it?</p>

<h3>"BLAGUEUR" AND "BLACKGUARD."</h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. vii., p. 77.)</p>

<p>I cannot concur in opinion with <span class="smcap">Sir Emerson Tennent</span>,
who thinks he has a right to identify the sense of our low word
<i>blagueur</i> with that of your lower one, <i>blackguard</i>. I
allow that there some slight similitude of pronunciation between
the words, but I contend that their sense is perfectly distinct, or,
rather, wholly different; as distant, in fact, as is the date of their
naturalisation in our respective idioms. Your <i>blackguard</i> had
already won a "local habitation and a name" under the reigns of Pope
and his immediate predecessor Dryden. Of all living unrespectable
characters our own <i>blagueur</i> is the youngest, the most innocent,
and the shyest. He is entirely of modern growth. He has but lately
emerged from the soldier's barracks, the suttler's shop, and the
mess-room. As a prolific tale-teller he amused the leisure hours of
superannuated sergeants and half-pay subalterns. Ten or twelve years
ago he had not yet made his appearance in plain clothes; he is now
creeping and winding his way with slow and sure steps from his
old haunts into some first-rate coffee-houses and shabby-genteel
drawing-rooms, which Carlyle calls <i>sham gentility</i>. He bears on
his very brow the newest <i>flunky-stamp</i>. The poor young fellow,
after all, is no villain; he has no kind of connexion with the
horrid rascal <span class="smcap">Sir Emerson Tennent</span> alludes to&mdash;with the
<i>blackguard</i>. That he is a boaster, a talker, an idiot, a
nincompoop; that he scatters "words, words, words," as Polonius did of
old; that he is bombastic, wordy, prosy, nonsensical, and a fool,
no one will deny. But he is no rogue, though he utters rogueries and
drolleries. No one is justified in slandering him.</p>

<p>The <i>blackguard</i> is a dirty fellow in every sense of the word&mdash;a
<i>gredin</i> (a cur), the true translation, by-the-bye, of the word
<i>blackguard</i>. Voltaire, who dealt largely in Billingsgate, was
very fond of the word <i>gredin</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Je semble à trois <i>gredins</i>, dans leur petit cerveau,<br />
Que pour être imprimés et reliés en veau," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The word <i>blagueur</i> implies nothing so contemptuous or offensive
as the word <i>blackguard</i> does. The emptiness of the person to
whom it applies is very harmless. Its etymon <i>blague</i> (bladder,
<i>tobacco-bag</i>), the pouch, which smoking voluptuaries use to
deposit their tobacco, is perfectly symbolic of the inane, bombastic,
windy, and long-winded speeches and sayings of the <i>blagueur</i>.
Every French commercial traveller, buss-tooter, and Parisian jarvy
is one. When he deports himself with modesty, and shows a gentlemanly
tact in his peculiar avocation, we call him a <i>craqueur</i> (a
cracker). "Ancient Pistol" was the king of <i>blagueurs</i>; Falstaff,
of <i>craqueurs</i>. I like our <i>Baron de Crac</i>, a native of the
land of white-liars and honey-tongued gentlemen (Gascony). The genus
<i>craqueur</i> is common here: as it shoots out into a thousand
branches, shades, varieties, and modifications, judicial, political,
poetical, and so on, it would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="page415" id="page415">{415}</a></span> quite out of my province to
pursue farther the description of <i>blagueur</i>-land or
<i>blarney</i>-land.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Excuse my French-English.</p>

<h3>HARMONY OF THE FOUR GOSPELS.</h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. viii., p. 316.)</p>

<p>In answer to Z. I may state that the first attempt of this kind is
attributed to Tatian. Eusebius, in his <i>Ecc. Hist.</i> (quoted in
Lardner's <i>Works</i>, vol. ii. p. 137. ed. 1788), says, he "composed
I know not what&mdash;harmony and collection of the gospels, which he
called <span lang='el' title='dia tessar&#244;n'>&#948;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#969;&#957;</span>." Eusebius himself composed a celebrated
harmony, of which, as of some others in the sixteenth and two
following centuries, there is a short account in Michaelis's
<i>Introduction to the New Test.</i>, translated by Bishop Marsh, vol.
iii. part <span class="smcap">I.</span> p. 32. The few works of the same kind written
in the early and middle ages are noticed in Horne's <i>Introduct.</i>,
vol. ii. p. 274. About the year 330, Juvencus, a Spaniard, wrote the
evangelical history in heroic verse. Of far greater merit were the
four books of Augustine, <i>De Consensu Quatuor Evangeliorum</i>.
After a long interval, Ludolphus the Saxon, a Carthusian monk,
published a work which passed through thirty editions in Germany,
besides being translated into French and Italian. Some years ago I
made out the following list of Harmonies, Diatessarons, and Synoptical
tables, published since the Reformation, which may in some measure
meet the wish of your correspondent. It is probably incomplete. The

<p>Tatian wrote his <span lang='el' title='Euangelion dia t&#244;n tessar&#244;n'>&#917;&#965;&#945;&#957;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#969;&#957;</span>
as early as the year 170. It is no longer extant, but we have some reason for
believing that this Harmony had been compiled in an unfriendly spirit
(Theodoret, <i>H&aelig;ret. Fabul.</i>, lib. i. c. 20.). Tatian was followed
by Ammonius, whose <span lang='el' title='Harmonia'>&#919;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#945;</span> appeared about 230; and in the
next century by Eusebius and St. Ambrose, the former entitling his

the latter <i>Concordia Evangelii Matt&aelig;i et Luc&aelig;</i>. But by far the ablest
of the ancient writings on this subject is the <i>De Consensu
Evangelistarum</i> of St. Augustine. Many authors, such as Porphyry,
in his <span lang='el' title='Kata Christian&#244;n logoi'>&#922;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span>,
had pointed with an air of triumph to the seeming discrepancies in the Evangelic records as an
argument subversive of their claim to paramount authority ("Hoc enim
solent quasi palmare su&aelig; vanitatis objicere, quod ipsi Evangelist&aelig;
inter seipsos dissentiant."&mdash;Lib. i. c. 7.). In writing these
objections St. Augustine had to handle nearly all the difficulties
which offend the microscopic critics of the present day. His work
was urged afresh upon the notice of the biblical scholar by Gerson,

<h3>SMALL WORDS AND LOW WORDS.</h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. ii., pp. 305. 349. 377.; Vol. iii., p. 309.)</p>

<p>A passage in Churchill, and one in Lord John Russell's <i>Life of
Moore</i>, have lately reminded me of a former Note of mine on this
subject. The structure of Churchill's second couplet must surely have
been suggested by that of Pope, which formed my original text:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Conjunction, adverb, preposition, join</p>
<p class="i2">  To add new vigour to the nervous line:&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">  In monosyllables his thunders roll,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">  He, she, it, and, we, ye, they, fright the soul."</p>
<p class="i8"><i>Censure on Mossop.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Moore, in his Journals, notes, on the other side of the question,
conversation between Rogers, Crowe, and himself, "on the beauty of
monosyllabic verses. 'He jests at scars,' &amp;c.; the couplet, 'Sigh on
my lip,' &amp;c.; 'Give all thou canst,' &amp;c. &amp;c., and many others, the
most vigorous and musical, perhaps, of any." (Lord John Russell's
<i>Moore</i>, vol. ii. p. 200.)</p>

<p>The frequency of monosyllabic lines in English poetry will hardly be
wondered at, however it may be open to such criticisms as Pope's
and Churchill's, when it is noted that our language contains, of
monosyllables formed by the vowel <i>a</i> alone, considerably more
than 500; by the vowel <i>e</i>, about 450; by the vowel <i>i</i>,
nearly 400; by the vowel <i>o</i>, rather more than 400; and by the
vowel <i>u</i>, upwards of 260; a calculation entirely exclusive of
the large number of monosyllables formed by diphthongs.</p>

<p>I hardly know whether the following "literary folly" (as "D'Israeli
the Elder" would call it, see <i>Curiosities of Lit.</i> sub tit.),
suggested by dipping into the above monosyllabical statistics, will
be thought worthy to occupy a column of "N. &amp; Q." However, it may take
its chance as a supplementary Note, without farther preface, under the

<h3>A CHAPTER ON RINGS.</h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. vii. <i>passim.</i>)</p>

<p>The Scriptures prove the use of rings in remote antiquity. In Gen.
xli., Joseph has conferred on him the king's ring, an instance more
ancient than Prometheus, whom fables call the inventor of the ring.
Therefore let those who will hold, with Pliny and his followers, that
its use is more recent than Homer. The Greeks seem to have derived the
custom of wearing it from the East, and Italy from the Greeks. Juvenal
and Persius refer to<span class='pagenum'><a name="page417" id="page417">{417}</a></span> rings which were worn only on birthdays. Clemens
Alexandrinus recommends a limit within which the liberty of engraving
upon them should be restrained. He thinks we should not allow an idol,
a sword, a bow, or a cup, much less naked human figures; but a dove,
a fish, or a ship in full sail, or a lyre, an anchor, or fishermen.
By the dove he would denote the Holy Spirit; by the fish, the dinner
which Christ prepared for his disciples (John xxi.), or the feeding of
thousands (Luke ix.); by a ship, either the Church or human life; by a
lyre, harmony; by an anchor, constancy; by fishermen, the apostles or
the baptism of children. It is a wonder he did not mention the symbol
of the name of Christ (<span lang='el' title='Chi-rho'>&#935;&#961;</span>), the cross which is found
on ancient gems, and Noah's ark.</p>

<p>Rings were worn upon the joints and fingers, and hence Clement says
a man should not wear a ring upon the joint (<i>in articulo</i>), for
this is what women do, but upon the little finger, and at its lowest
part. He failed to observe the Roman custom of wearing the ring upon
the finger of the left hand, which is nearest the heart, and which we
therefore term the ring-finger. And Macrobius says, that when a ring
fell from the little finger of Avienus' right hand, those who were
present asked why he placed it upon the wrong hand and finger, not
on those which had been set apart for this use. The reasons which
are given for this custom in Macrobius were often laughed at by H.
Fabricius ab Aquapendente, viz. that it is stated in anatomical works,
that "a certain nerve which rises at the heart proceeds directly to
that finger of the left hand which is next the little finger," for
nothing of the sort, he said, existed in the human body.</p>

<p>The ring distinguished the free-born from the servile, who, however,
sometimes obtained the <i>jus annuli</i>, or privilege of the ring.
It was used as a seal, a pledge, and a bond. Women, when betrothed,
received rings; and the virgin and martyr Agnes, in Ambrose, says, "My
Lord Jesus Christ hath espoused me with his ring." Theosebius also, in
Photius, says to his wife, "I formerly gave to thee the ring of union,
now of temperance, to aid thee in the seemly custody of my house." He
advisedly speaks of that <i>custody</i>, for the lady of the house in
Plautus says,</p>

<blockquote><p>"Obsignate cellas, referte annulum ad me:<br />
  Ego huc transeo."</p></blockquote>

<p>Wives generally used the same seals as their husbands: thus Cicero
(<i>Ad Attic.</i> xi. 9) says, "Pomponia, I believe, has the seals of
what is sealed." Sometimes, however, they used their own.</p>

<p>Touching the marriage ring, of what style and material it was, and
whether formerly, as now, consecrated by prayers to God. Its pattern
appears to have been one which has gone out of use, viz. right
hands joined, such as is often observed on ancient coins. Tacitus
(<i>Hist.</i> i. ll.) calls it absolutely <i>dextras</i>, right hands.
Among us it was called a faith (<i>una fede.</i> Comp. Eng. "Plight
my <i>troth</i>"), and not without precedent, for on the coins of
Vitellius, &amp;c. right hands thus joined bear the motto <i>Fides</i>. An
esteemed writer (Nider), in his <i>Formicarium</i>, mentions a rustic
virgin who desired to find a material ring as a token of her espousal
"<i>in signum Christifer&aelig; desponsationis</i>," and found a ring of
a white colour, like pure silver, upon which two hands were engraved
where it was united. It was formerly customary to bless a crown or a
ring by prayers. The form of consecration used by the priest is thus
given in ancient liturgies:</p>


<blockquote><p>"Bene <img src="images/image01.png" width="15" height="15" alt="cross" />
    die Domine, Annulum istum et coronam istam, ut
    sicut Annulus circundat digitum hominis, et corona caput,
    ita gratia Spiritus Sancti circundet sponsum et sponsam,
    ut videant filios et filias usque tertiam et quartam
    generationem: qui collaudent nomen viventis atque regnantis in
    secula seculorum. Amen."</p></blockquote>

<p>For the crown, see Is. lxii. 1. (E. V. lxi. 10.). The words of Agnes
above cited have reference to giving the right hand and a pledge.</p>

<p>These particulars are from the <i>Symbol. Epist. Liber</i> of
Laurentius Pignorius, Patar. 1628; where, in Ep. I. and XIX., many
other references are to be found.</p>

<h3>ANTICIPATORY USE OF THE CROSS.&mdash;RINGING BELLS FOR THE DEAD.</h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. viii., pp. 130. 132.)</p>

<p>I trust that the following information may be acceptable to you and
the authors of two interesting papers in "N. &amp; Q." (Vol. viii., pp.
130-2.), viz. "Anticipatory Use of the Cross," and "Curious Custom of
ringing Bells for the Dead."</p>

<p>When encamped, in 1823 or 1824, near the town (not the cantonment)
of Muttra, on the river Jumna, a place of celebrated sanctity as the
scene of the last incarnation of Vishnoo, the protective deity or
myth of the Hindoos, an Italian gentleman of most polished manners,
speaking English correctly and with fluency, was introduced to me. He
travelled under the name of Count Venua, and was understood to be the
eldest son of the then Prime Minister of Sardinia. The Count explained
to me that his favourite pursuit was architecture, and that he
preferred buildings of antiquity. I replied, that while breakfast
was preparing I could meet his wishes, and led him to a large Hindoo
edifice close by (or rather the remains), which a Mogul emperor had
partially destroyed and thereby desecrated, the place having since
been occasionally used by the townspeople as a cattle-shed, or for
rubbish.</p>

<p>The Count, not deterred by heaps of cattle-dung, paced the dimensions,
gazed on the solidity of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="page418" id="page418">{418}</a></span> stone masonry, approved of the
construction and shape of the arched roof, pointed out the absence
of all ornament excepting a simple moulding or two as architectural
lines, and then broke out into enthusiastic admiration. "The most
beautiful building! the greatest wonder of the world! Shame on
the English government and English gentlemen for secreting such a
curiosity! Here is the cross! the basilica carried out with more
correctness of order and symmetry than in Italy! The early Christians
must have built it! I will take measurements and drawings to lay
before the cardinals!"</p>

<p>I was never more surprised, and assured the Count that I was
unacquainted with the cathedral buildings of Europe, and I believed
English gentlemen generally to be as ignorant as myself. I could not
but acknowledge that the local governments had, as it seemed to him,
evinced but little sympathy with Hindooism; and that whatever might be
European policy in respect to religion, the East India Company might
have participated in the desire which prevails in Europe to develop
ancient customs, and the reasons of those customs. It might be
presumed that we should then have contemplated this specimen of
architecture with a knowledge of its original purposes, and the
history of its events, had the Governor-General communicated his
wish, and with due courtesy and disinterestedness invited the learned
persons and scholars at the colleges of Muttra and Benares to assist
such inquiries. It is but little the English now know of the Hindoo
organisation, and the little they do know is derived from books not
tested nor acknowledged by such learned persons.</p>

<p>I assisted Count Venua as far as I was able, for I rejoiced at his
intention to draw the minds of the <i>literati</i> of Italy to the
subject. Sad to say, the Count was some time after killed by falling
into a volcanic crater in the Eastern Isles!</p>

<p>I may here mention that I first saw the old building in 1809, when
a youthful assistant to the secretary of a revenue commission. The
party, during the inclement month of September, resided in one of
the spacious houses at Muttra, which pious Hindoos had in past times
erected for the use of pilgrims and the public. The old temple (or
whatever it might have been) was cleaned out for our accommodation
during the heat of the day, as it then was cooler than the house.
The elder civilians were men of ability, classical scholars, and
first-rate Asiatic linguists. They descanted on the mythological
events which renders "Brij," or the country around Muttra, so holy
with the Hindoos, but not one of them knew nor remarked the "cross and
basilica."</p>

<p>In youth, the language assigned to flowers appeared to me captivating
and elegant, as imparting the finer feelings and sympathies of our
nature. In maturer age, and after the study of the history of the
customs of mankind, symbols and emblems seemed to me an universal
language, which delicately delineated the violent passions of
our kind, and transmitted from generation to generation national
predilections and pious emotions towards the God of Creation. That
mythology should so generally be interpreted Theism, and that forms
or ceremonials of worship should be held to limit and define belief in
creed, may, in my apprehension, be partly traceable to the school-book
Lamprière's <i>Classical Dictionary</i>. You or your correspondents
may attribute it to other and truer causes.</p>

<p>The rose, the thistle, the shamrock, the leek, the lion, the unicorn,
the harp, &amp;c. are familiar examples of national emblems. The ivy, the
holly, and the mistletoe are joined up with the Christmas worship,
though probably of Druidical origin. The Assyrian sculptures present,
under the "Joronher," or effulgence, a sacred tree, which may
assimilate with the toolsu and the peepul tree, held in almost equal
veneration by the Hindoos. The winged lions and bulls with the heads
of men, the angels and cherubim, recall to mind passages of scriptural
and pagan history. The sciences of astronomy and mathematics have
afforded myths or symbols in the circle, the crescent, the bident, the
trident, the cross, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The translators of the cuneiform inscriptions represent crucifixion
as the common punishment for rebellion and treason. The Jews may have
imitated the Assyrians, as crucifixion may have been adopted
long before that of Christ and the two thieves (Qy. robbers). The
Mahomedans, who have copied the Jews in many practices and customs,
executed gang robbers or daccorts by suspending the criminals from
a tree, their heads and arms being tied to the branches, and then
ripping up the abdomen. I myself saw in Oude an instance of several
bodies. It may be inferred, then, that the position of the culprits
under execution was designated by crucifixion. The Hindoos mildly say
that when their system of government existed in efficiency there was
neither crime nor punishment.</p>

<p>To the examples mentioned by your correspondent, I admit that the form
of the cross, as now received, may be derived from that of Christ,
discovered on Mount Calvary in 236 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Constantine, in 306
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, adopted it as a standard in Labarum. Other nations
have attached staves to eagles, dragons, fish, &amp;c. as standards
and therefore, construing "Crux ansata" literally, the ensign of
Constantine might be formed by attaching a staff to the Divine Glory
represented in the Egyptian paintings and Assyrian sculptures.</p>

<p>I should be glad to learn the precise shape of the cross on the Temple
of Serapis. If it be the emblem of life or the Creative Power, then
the mythology of the Nile agrees with that of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="page419" id="page419">{419}</a></span> Ganges. If it be the
symbol of life, or rather of a future state after judgment, then the
religious tenets and creed of Muttra should be elucidated, examined,
and refuted by the advocates of conversion and their itinerant agents.
Moore's <i>Hindoo Pantheon</i> (though the author had at Bombay, as
a military officer, little opportunity of ascertaining particulars of
the doctrine) sufficiently treats, under the head of the "Krishna,"
the subject so as to explain to the conversionists, that unless this
doctrine be openly refuted, the missionaries may in truth be fighting
their own shadow.</p>

<p>The basilica seems to have originally been the architectural plan
of the Roman Forum, or court of justice. The Christians may have
converted some of these edifices into churches; otherwise the first
churches seem to have been in the form of a long parallelogram,
a central nave, and an aisle on each side, the eastern end being
rounded, as the station of the bishop or presbyter. The basilica, or
cathedral, was probably not introduced until the eighth century, or
later.</p>

<p>I have not just now access to the works of Tod and Maurice. The
former, I doubt not, is correct in respect to the Temple of Mundore,
but I believe the latter is not so in regard to Benares. The trident,
like that of Neptune, prevails in the province of Benares; and when
it, in appropriate size, rises in the centre of large tanks, has
a very solemn effect. I, a great many years ago, visited the chief
temple of Benares, and do not recollect that the cross was either
noticed to me or by me. This, I think, was the only occasion of
observing the forms of worship. There is no fixed service, no
presiding priest, no congregation. The people come and go in
succession. I then first saw the bell, which, in size some twenty-five
pounds weight, is suspended within the interior. Each person, at some
period of his devotion, touched the tongue of the bell as invocation
or grace. The same purpose is obtained by Hindoos, and particularly
the men of the fighting classes, previously to commencing a cooked
dinner, by winding a large shell, which gives a louder sound than
a horn. The native boys however, on hearing it, exclaim in doggerel
rhyme, which I translate,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">"The shell is blown,</p>
<p class="i4">And the devil is flown."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Fear seems so much the parent of superstition, that I attribute this
saying to the women, who, as mothers, have usually a superstitious
dread not only of evil spirits, but also of the evil eye of mortals
towards their young ones. When, some twenty years ago, I was told by a
Kentish countryman that the church bell was tolled to drive away evil
spirits from a departing soul, I supposed the man to be profanely
jocose; but since then I have travelled much in this country and on
the Continent, and have seen enough to satisfy me that superstition
prevails comparatively less in Asia than in Europe and the pages of
"N. &amp; Q." abundantly corroborate the opinion.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p><i>Stereoscopic Angles.</i>&mdash;I am concerned that my definition
and solution of stereoscopic angles (a misnomer, for it should be
<i>space</i>) in "N. &amp; Q.," with subsequent illustrations, have not
satisfied <span class="smcap">Mr. Shadbolt</span>, as I am thus obliged to once more
request room in your pages, and this time for a rather long letter.
When I asserted that my method is the only correct one, it behoved me
to be prepared to prove it, which I am, and will now do.</p>

<p>It seems that <span class="smcap">Mr. Shadbolt</span> has not a knowledge of
perspective, or, with a little reflection and trifling pains in
linear demonstration on paper, he might have convinced himself of
the accuracy of my method. It were well, then, to inform <span class="smcap">Mr.
Shadbolt</span>, that in perspective, planes parallel to the plane
of delineation (in this case, the glass at back of camera) have no
vanishing points; that planes at right angles to plane of delineation
have but one; and that planes oblique have but one vanishing point, to
the right or left, as it may be, of the observer's eye. This promised,
let the subject be a wall 300 feet in length, with two abutments of
one foot in front and five feet in projection, and each placed five
feet from the central point of the wall, which is to have a plinth at
its base, and a stone coping at top. On a pedestal four feet high, two
feet wide, and six feet long, exactly midway betwixt the abutments,
let an ass be placed, a boy astride him, a bag drawn before the boy,
who holds up a long stick in line with the ass, &amp;c., that is, facing
the observer. The right distance for the observer's place is 450 feet.
If the cameras be placed two inches and a half apart, on one line
parallel to the wall, the stereographs will be in true perspective for
the <i>two</i> eyes, that is, all the planes at right angles to the
plane of delineation will have <i>two</i> vanishing points, which,
being merely two inches and a half apart, will, in the stereoscope,
flow easily into one opposite the eye; whilst the plinth, coping, and
all lines parallel to them, will be perfectly horizontal; and the two
pictures would create in the mind just such a conception as the
same objects would if seen by the eyes naturally. This would be
stereoscopic, true to nature, true to art, and, I affirm, correct.</p>

<p>Now, let the same subject be treated by Professor Wheatstone's method,
when the cameras would be eighteen feet apart. Situated thus, if
placed on one line, and that parallel to the wall, the extreme end
at the right could not be seen by the camera at the left, and <i>vice
versâ</i>; so that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="page420" id="page420">{420}</a></span> must radiate from the centre when the glass at
back of camera would be oblique to the wall, and the plinth, coping,
top and bottom of pedestal, would have <i>two</i> vanishing points,
at opposite sides of the centre, or observer's eye; both sides of the
ass, both the legs of boy, and two heads to the drum would be visible;
whilst the two sides of pedestals would have each a vanishing point,
serving for all lines parallel to them. But these vanishing points
would be so far apart that they could not, in the stereoscope, flow
into one: the result would be, that the buttresses would be wider at
back than in front, as would also the pedestal, while the stick held
by the boy would appear like <i>two</i> sticks united in front. This
would be untrue to nature, false to art, preposterously absurd, and I
pronounce it to be altogether erroneous.</p>

<p>This being the case with a long distance, so must it be with shorter
distances, modified in exact proportion to the diminution of space
between the cameras, &amp;c. For, let the object be a piece of wood three
feet long, four inches wide, and six inches deep, with a small square
piece one inch and six inches high, placed upright exactly on a line
from end to end of the three feet (that is, one at each end) and
midway between the sides. Let this arrangement be placed across
another piece of wood three or four feet long, which will thus be
at right angles to the piece at top. By my method all will be
correct&mdash;true to nature and to art, and perfectly stereoscopic: whilst
by the radial method (recommended by <span class="smcap">Mr. Shadbolt</span>), with two
feet space for cameras, there would be the top piece divided at the
farther end, where there would be two small upright pieces instead
of one; and this because the two vanishing points could not, in
stereoscope, flow into one: whilst the lower piece of wood would have
two vanishing points at opposite sides. This, then, being untrue to
nature, untrue in art, in short, a most absurd misrepresentation, I
pronounce to be utterly wrong. I have made the space two feet between
cameras in order to show how ridiculous those pictures might become
where there is an absence of taste, as, by such a person, two or ten
feet are as likely to be taken as any less offensively incorrect.</p>

<p>As regards range of vision, I apologise to <span class="smcap">Mr. Shadbolt</span> for
having misconceived his exact meaning, and say that I perfectly agree
with him.</p>

<p>With respect to the "trifling exaggeration" I spoke of, allow me to
explain. For the sake of clearness, I denominate the angle formed from
the focal point of lens, and the glass at back of camera, the angle
of delineation; the said glass the plane of delineation and the angle
formed by the stereograph to the eye, the stereoscopic angle. It must
be borne in mind that the stereoscopic angle is that subtended by
one stereograph and the eye. I find by experiments that the angle of
delineation is very often larger than the stereoscopic angle, so that
the apparent enlargement spoken of by <span class="smcap">Mr. Shadbolt</span> does not
often exist; but if it did, as my vision (though excellent) is not
acute enough to discover the discrepancy, I was content. I doubt not,
however, under such circumstances, <span class="smcap">Mr. Shadbolt</span> would prefer
the deformities and errors proved to be present, since he has admitted
that he has such preference. I leave little doubt that, if desirable,
the stereoscopic angle, and that of delineation, could be generally
made to agree.</p>

<p>As to the means by which persons with two eyes, or with only one eye,
judge of distance, I say not one word, that being irrelevant to
this subject. But that the axes of the eyes approximate when we view
objects nearer and nearer cannot be doubted, and I expressed no
doubt; and it appears to me very probable that on this fact <span class="smcap">Mr.
Shadbolt</span> founds his conclusion that the cameras should radiate.
This, however, ought not to be done for the reasons I have assigned.
It will not do to treat the cameras as two eyes, and make them radiate
because our eyes do; for it must be remembered that light entering the
eyes is received on curved&mdash;whilst when it enters the cameras it falls
on flat surfaces, occasioning very different results. And if this be
maturely considered by <span class="smcap">Mr. Shadbolt</span>, I believe his opinion
will be greatly altered.</p>

<p>As to the model-like appearance, I cannot yet understand exactly why
it should exist; but of this I am certain, the eyes naturally do not
perceive at one view three sides of a cake (that is, two sides and the
front), nor two heads to a drum, nor any other like absurdity; so that
I perceive no analogy between this model-like appearance and natural
vision, as stated to be the case by <span class="smcap">Mr. Shadbolt</span>.</p>

<p>To confirm, practically, the truth of my illustrative proofs, I will
send you next week some glass stereographs, to be placed at <span class="smcap">Mr.
Shadbolt's</span> disposal, if he likes, and you will be so kind as to
take charge of them.</p>

a very probable construction of the sense of the word. But the etymon

<p><i>Gloves at Fairs</i> (Vol. viii., p. 136.).&mdash;As an emblem of power
and an acknowledgment of goodness, "Saul set up a hand" after his
victory over the Amalekites, 1 Sam. <span class="smcap">xv.</span> 12., (Taylor's
<i>Hebrew Concordance</i>, in voce, <span lang='el' title='YDH'><span class='lfont'>&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;</span>)</span> Sam 2 xviii.
18., Isaiah lvi. 5. The Ph&oelig;nician monuments are said to have had
sculptured on them an arm and <i>hand held up</i>, with an inscription
graven thereon. (See Gesenius and Lee.) If, as stated by your
correspondents in the article referred to, the glove at fairs "denotes
protection," and indicates "that parties frequenting the fair are
exempt from arrest," it is at least a remarkable coincidence. The
Ph&oelig;nicians were the earliest merchants to the west of England
that we have any account of; can any connexion be traced historically
between the Ph&oelig;nician traffic and the modern practice of setting
up a hand, or glove, at fairs? I well remember the feelings of awe and
wonder with which I gazed when taken in childhood to see "the glove
brought in" and placed over the guildhall of my native city (Exeter)
at the commencement of "Lammas Fair." Has the glove been associated
with this fair from its commencement? and if not, how far back can
its use be traced? The history of the fair is briefly this: it existed
before the Norman Conquest, and was a great mart of business; the
tolls had belonged to the corporation, but King John took one-half,
and gave them to the priory of St. Nicholas. Henry VIII. sold the fair
with the priory; and anno second and third of Philip and Mary it was
made over to the corporation, who have ever since been lords of the
fair. (Izacke's <i>Memorials</i>, p. 19.; Oliver's <i>History of
Exeter</i>, pp. 83. 158., &amp;c.)</p>

<p>I may add that at Barnstaple, North Devon, the evening previous to
the proclamation of the fair, a large glove, decked with dahlias, is
protruded on a pole from a window of the Quay Hall, the most ancient
building in the town, which remains during the fair, and is removed at
its termination. May not the outstretched glove signify the consent
of the authorities to the commencement and continuance of the
festivities, &amp;c., and its withdrawal a hint for their cessation?</p>

<p>I may add also that on the morning of proclaiming the fair, the mayor
and corporation meet their friends in the council chamber, and partake
of spiced toast and ale.</p>

<p><i>"An" before "u" long</i> (Vol. viii., p. 244.).&mdash;The custom of
writing <i>an</i> before <i>u</i> long must have arisen and become
established when <i>u</i> had its primitive and vowel sound, nearly
resembling that of our <i>oo</i>, a sound which it still has in
several languages, but seems to have lost in ours. The use of
<i>an</i> before <i>u</i> long, was <i>then</i> proper; habit and
precedent will account for its retention by many, after the reason for
it has ceased, and when its use has become improper. But although the
custom is thus accounted for, there exists no satisfactory reason for
its continuance, and I am sorry to learn from your correspondent that
it is "increasingly prevailing."</p>

<p><i>"The Good Old Cause"</i> (Vol. viii, p. 44.).&mdash;D'Israeli, in
<i>Quarrels of Authors</i>, under the head of "Martin Mar-Prelate,"
has the following remarks on the origin and use of the expression,
"The Good Old Cause:"</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is remarkable that Udall repeatedly employed that
    expression, which Algernon Sidney left as his last legacy to
    the people, when he told them he was about to die for 'that
    <i>Old Cause</i>, in which I was from my youth engaged.' Udall
    perpetually insisted on '<i>The Cause</i>.' This was a
    term which served at least for a watch-word: it rallied the
    scattered members of the republican party. The precision of
    the expression might have been difficult to ascertain; and,
    perhaps, like every popular expedient, varied with 'existing
    circumstances.' I did not, however, know it had so remote an
    origin as in the reign of Elizabeth; and suspect it may still
    be freshened up and varnished over for any present occasion."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Humbug</i> (Vol. vii., p. 631.).&mdash;The real signification of the
word <i>humbug</i> appears to me to lie in the following derivation
of it. Among the many issues of base coin which from time to time were
made in Ireland, there was none to be compared in worthlessness
to that made by James II. from the Dublin Mint; it was composed
of anything on which he could lay his hands, such as lead, pewter,
copper, and brass, and so low was its intrinsic value, that twenty
shillings of it was only worth twopence sterling. William III., a few
days after the Battle of the Boyne, ordered that the crown piece
and half-crown should be taken as one penny and one halfpenny
respectively. The soft mixed metal of which that worthless coining
was composed, was known among the Irish as <i>Uim bog</i>, pronounced
<i>Oom-bug</i>, <i>i.e.</i> soft copper, <i>i.e.</i> worthless
money; and in the course of their dealings the modern use of the word
<i>humbug</i> took its rise, as in the phrases "that's a <i>piece
of uimbog</i> (humbug)," "don't think to <i>pass off</i> your
<i>uimbug</i> on me." Hence the word <i>humbug</i> came to be applied
to anything that had a specious appearance, but which was in
reality spurious. It is curious to note that the very opposite of
<i>humbug</i>, <i>i.e.</i> false metal, is the word <i>sterling</i>,
which is also taken from a term applied to the <i>true</i> coinage
of the realm, as <i>sterling</i> coin, <i>sterling</i> truth,
<i>sterling</i> worth, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>"Hurrah!"</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 20, 277, 323.).&mdash;It would almost
deem that we are never to hear the last of "Hurrah! and other
war-cries." Your correspondents T. F. and <span class="smcap">Sir J. Emerson
Tennent</span> appear to me to have made the nearest approach to a
satisfactory solution of the difficulty; a step farther and the goal
is won&mdash;the object of inquiry is found. I suppose it will be admitted
that the language which supplies the <i>meaning</i> of a word has the
fairest claim to be considered its <i>parent</i> language. What, then,
is the meaning of "Hurrah," and in whet language? As a reply to this
Query, allow me to quote a writer in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>,
April 1843, p. 477.</p>

<blockquote><p>"'Hurrah!' means <i>strike</i> in the Tartar language."&mdash;Note
    to art. "Amulet Bek."</p></blockquote>

<p>So then, according to this respectable authority, the end of our
shouts and war-cries is, that we have "caught a Tartar!"</p>

<p>Again, in <i>Blackwood</i>, 1849, vol. i. p.673., we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>"He opened a window and cried 'Hourra!' At the signal, a
    hundred soldiers crowded into the house. Mastering his
    fury, the Czar ordered the young officer to be taken to
    prison."&mdash;Art. "Romance of Russian History."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, in describing the "awful pause" on the night preceding the
Russian attack on Ismail, then in possession of the Turks, Lord Byron
says:</p>

one "to get into a scrape." Both are metaphors, derived from the
unpleasant sensations produced by rubbing or grazing the skin. The
word <i>pinch</i> is, on the same principle, used for difficulty; and
the Lat. <i>tribulatio</i>=trouble, and its synonym in Gr.,

of George Synge, Bishop of Cloyne, born 1594? Of what family was Mary
Paget, wife of the Rev. Richard Synge, preacher at the Savoy in 1715?
The name appears to have been indifferently spelt, Sing, Singe, and
Synge. And I believe an older branch than the baronet's still exists
at Bridgenorth, writing themselves Sing. The punning motto of this
family is worth noticing: "Celestia canimus."</p>

<p><i>Lines on Woman</i> (Vol. viii., p. 350).&mdash;Your correspondent F. W.
J. has occasioned me some perplexity in tracing the quotation which he
refers to Vol. viii., p. 204., but which is really to be found at p.
292. He appears to have fallen into this error by mistaking the number
on the right hand for the paging on the left. As accuracy in these
matters is essential in a publication like "N. &amp; Q.," he will excuse
me for setting him right. The name of the author of the poem of
"Woman" was not Eton Barrett, but Eaton Stannard Barrett. He was
connected with the press in London. Your correspondent is correct in
stating that the Barretts were from Cork. Eaton Stannard Barrett was
a man of considerable ability. He published several works anonymously,
all of which acquired celebrity; but I believe the poem of "Woman,"
published by Mr. Colburn, was the only work to which he attached his
name. He was the author of the well-known political satire called
<i>All the Talents</i>; of the mock romance of <i>The Heroine</i>,
in which the absurdities of a school of fiction, at that time in high
favour, are happily ridiculed; and of a novel which had great success
in its day, and is still to be found in some of the circulating
libraries, called <i>Six Weeks at Long's</i>. Eaton Stannard Barrett
died many years ago in the prime of his life and powers. His brother,
Richard Barrett, is still living, and resides in the neighbourhood
of Dublin. He is the author of some controversial and political
pamphlets, of which the principal were <i>Irish Priests</i>, and
<i>The Bible not a Dangerous Book</i>. He afterwards conducted <i>The
Pilot</i> newspaper, established for the support of Mr. O'Connell's
policy in Ireland, and was one of the persons who suffered
imprisonment with Mr. O'Connell, and who were designated in the Irish
papers as the "martyrs."</p>

<h3>Notices to Correspondents.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Books Wanted.</span> <i>So many of our Correspondents seem disposed
to avail themselves of our plan of placing the booksellers in direct
communication with them, that we find ourselves compelled to limit
each list of books to two insertions. We would also express a hope
that those gentlemen who may at once succeed in obtaining any desired
volumes will be good enough to notify the same to us, in order that
such books may not unnecessarily appear in such list even a second
time.</i></p>

<p>P. G. <i>We are not in a position to answer</i> P. G.'s<i> inquiries.
Why not try one of the series and judge for yourself?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A German Investigator</span>, <i>who states that some important
moves towards the "flying by man" have lately been made upon the
Continent, and who inquires "what noblemen or gentlemen would be
likely to foster similar researches in this country," should rather
address himself to some of the journals devoted to mechanical
science.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sciolus.</span> <i>The author of</i> Doctor Syntax <i>was the
well-known</i> William Coombe, <i>a curious list of whose works will
be found in the</i> Gentleman's Magazine <i>for May, 1852, p. 467.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Demayne.</span> <i>We have a letter for this Correspondent;
where shall it be sent?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erica</span> <i>will find his illustration of Campbell's</i> Like
Angel Visits <i>anticipated in our</i> 1st Vol.</p>

<p>J. N. C. (King's Lynn). <i>We have one or two Replies on the same
subject already in the Printer's hands.</i></p>

<p>A. J. V. (University Club) <i>will find his Query respecting</i>
Solamen miseris, &amp;c. <i>in</i> Vol. viii., p. 272., <i>and an answer
respecting</i> Tempora mutantur <i>in</i> p. 306.</p>

<p><i>Our Correspondent</i> C. E. F. (p. 373.) <i>is informed</i>&mdash;1.
<i>That both the solutions of the muriate salts and the nitrate of
silver may be used in the manner he proposes; but a portion of sugar
of milk, mannite, or grape sugar, as has been previously recommended,
much accelerates the process.</i> 2. <i>The positives should be
printed about one-third deeper than is required, and they should
remain in the hypo. bath until the mottled appearance is removed,
which is visible when held up against the light and they are looked
through: at first the positive often assumes a very unpleasant red
colour; this gradually disappears by longer immersion, when the proofs
may be removed at the point of tint required, remembering that they
become rather darker when dry, especially if ironed, and which is
generally desirable, especially if the print is rather pale.</i> 3.
<i>The sel d'or does not seem to have the destructive effect which the
chloride of gold has, and if the chemicals are entirely removed, in
all probability they are quite permanent. Those which we have seen
printed several months since appear to have suffered no change.
Pictures produced by the ammonio-nitrate are most uncertain. There
are few who have not had the mortification to see some of their best
productions fade and disappear. A learned professor, about eighteen
months since, sent us a picture so printed "as something to work up
to;" a few yellowish stains are now all that remains on the paper.</i></p>

<p class='center'><i>Dr. Wurzer's Testimonial.</i></p>

<p class="regards">"Bonn, July 19, 1852.</p>

<p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases,
all kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of
body, as also diarrhoea, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys
and bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and
cramp of the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures,
and hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with
the most satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary
complaints, where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also
in pulmonary and bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts
effectually the troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth
to express the conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted
to the cure of incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF THE PEOPLE,</h4>

<p class="center"> Monthly Journal of Literature, Science, the Fine Arts, &amp;c., devoted
to the Religious, Moral, Physical, and Social Elevation of the great
body of the People.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>This periodical, projected and conducted by a committee of Clergy and
Laity, in the heart of the manufacturing districts, is intended
to express the sympathies of earnest Churchmen towards both their
brethren in the faith, and their fellow-men in general.</p>

<p>Designed to avoid unreality, lukewarmness, and dry dogmatism, as well
as compromise and controversy&mdash;and not unmindful of things temporal,
whilst chiefly directed to things eternal&mdash;it is hoped that it may
assist to refresh the faithful, correct the erring, and win the
unbeliever.</p>

<p>A trial is respectfully requested for it, and that at once.</p>

<p>It is a work of love, not of lucre; and, as such, is commended to the
brotherhood.</p>

<p>It will be eminently fitted for parochial distribution and, by God's
blessing, may do its part towards removing English heathenism.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>&#8258;Suggestions and communications, written in a plain, earnest, and
attractive style, are respectfully requested, and may be addressed
to the editors of "The Church of the People," care of MR. SOWLER,
St. Ann's Square, Manchester, to whom books for review, and
advertisements, may be sent.</p>
